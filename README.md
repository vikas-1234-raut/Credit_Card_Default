We used the [**Credit Card Default payment in Taiwan**]
(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients) to **predict whether the credit card holders are defaulters or Non-defaulters**.

For Model Evaluation we are referreing Confusion Matrix
After we train a logistic regression model on some training data, we will evaluate the performance of the model on some test data. For this, we use the Confusion Matrix

the accuracy of the model : - ( TP + TN ) / Total

Here, TP stands for True Positive which are the cases in which we predicted yes and the actual value was true. TN stands for True Negative which are the cases in which we predicted no and the actual value was false.FP stands for False Positive which are the cases which we predicted yes and the actual value was False.FN stands for False Negative which are the cases which we predicted No and the actual value was true.
